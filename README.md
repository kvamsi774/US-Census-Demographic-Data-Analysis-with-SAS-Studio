# US-Census-Demographic-Data-Analysis-with-SAS-Studio

**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of US Census Demographic Data using SAS Studio. The dataset, sourced from the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS), offers a detailed picture of the US population, covering demographics, economics, and social characteristics. The project aims to uncover meaningful insights from this data through a combination of data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

**Data**

The dataset used in this project, "acs2017_county_data.csv", contains a wealth of information on various demographic and socioeconomic factors for US counties. This includes:

**Demographics:** Total population, gender distribution, racial and ethnic composition, age distribution.

**Economics:** Income (median household income, per capita income), employment status (employed, unemployed), occupation types.

**Social:** Poverty levels (overall and child poverty), commuting patterns (means of transportation, commute time).


**Methodology**

The project follows a structured approach to analyze the data:

**Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality and consistency.

**Visualization**: Creating various visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts) to explore patterns and relationships within the data.

**Statistical Analysis**: Conducting statistical tests (one-way frequency, correlation analysis, linear regression) to quantify relationships and draw inferences.


**Tools**

The primary tool used for this project is SAS Studio, a comprehensive software suite for data management, analysis, and reporting. Its capabilities in data visualization, statistical analysis, and report generation are leveraged extensively throughout the project.

**Key Findings**

The analysis revealed several interesting patterns:

**Population Distribution**: The US population is concentrated in a few states, with California, Texas, and Florida being the most populous. This distribution is influenced by economic opportunities, climate, and geography.

**Commute Time:** Mean commute time varies across states, with factors like urban sprawl and traffic congestion contributing to longer commutes. These longer commutes can have negative impacts on employee productivity and work-life balance.

**Income and Population:** There is a positive relationship between per capita income and total population at the county level, but this relationship also varies significantly. The type of industry and cost of living within a county influence this variation.


**Implications**
The findings of this project have several implications for policymakers, researchers, and businesses:

**Policymaking**: Understanding the distribution of population, income, and poverty can inform policies related to resource allocation, infrastructure development, and social welfare programs.

**Research:** The project highlights areas for future research, such as examining trends over time, disaggregating data for deeper analysis, and conducting comparisons with other countries.

**Business:** Businesses can gain insights into target demographics, their income levels, and employment characteristics, which can inform marketing strategies and product development.

By utilizing SAS Studio's powerful analytical capabilities, this project provides valuable insights into US Census Demographic Data, with potential applications in various domains. Further research and analysis can build upon these findings to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the diverse demographics and socioeconomic landscape of the United States.
